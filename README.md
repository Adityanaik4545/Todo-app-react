# React To-Do List (Practice Project)

This is a simple **To-Do List App** built using **React** as a practice project. I previously built a similar version using plain **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and rebuilt it in React to improve my skills with components, state management, and localStorage.

---

## Features

- Add new tasks
- Mark tasks as complete (with strike-through)
- Delete tasks
- Tasks saved using localStorage
- Built with React functional components and hooks

---

## Purpose

> ‚ÄúThis project was built to practice React fundamentals such as `useState`, `useEffect`, props, and component structure. I‚Äôm learning how to manage state in a clean, modular way compared to vanilla JavaScript.‚Äù

---

## Tech Stack

- React (with `useState`, `useEffect`)
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Tailwindcss
- localStorage API

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
